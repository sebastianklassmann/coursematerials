    "If you work with GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks, your life **will** be easier, if you only copy or move a file to the repository folder, once it is ready for review or sharing with the other course members. Git and GitHub will track any changes in files that are within the repository. However, the Jupyter Notebook file format is not plain text, so seeing differences in file versions in the *nano editor* can be challenging. We haven't discussed *merges* and the version tracking and comparison screens in detail yet.   \n",
